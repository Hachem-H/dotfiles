# .files
These are all the config files for the programs I use on the daily. Since I tend to use several machines each running different instances of linux, I created this repository so I would only have to clown it and use GNU-stow as follows,
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Hachem-H/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles && stow .
```
